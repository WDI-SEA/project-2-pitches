# Project 2 Pitch Guidelines

Project Description and Pitch Guidelines for SEIR SEA P2

---

## Project 2 Goals

In your second project you will create a full stack Express and Postgres app which has:

- _At least x2 models, and utilize and build at least one relationship between the two models._
- _Sequelize as an ORM to interact with and create your database._
- _An Express server utilizing EJS/EJS layouts for UI design and styling._
- _Interaction with and inclusion of at least one API._

## Project 2 Pitch Guidelines

In designing and building your project, you will start by forking and cloneing this repository, and then editing this README to include the following information:

1. Name of your app: Create-A-Recipe, Food From Fodder. This app will allow you to find recipes based on food that you have "on-hand".
2. Tech stack you plan to use: HTML, CSS - would like to employ Boostrap, Tailwinds, perhaps; JS, Express, NODE, NPM, EJS, Axios, Sequilize, PostgreSQL
3. Simple wireframes
   - Can be handdrawn, or with tool of your choice
   - Example online tool: [Miro.com](https://miro.com/)
4. API you plan to use
5. Example of how to call/invoke your API, and a description of what data comes back: Considering using Spoonacular API. It's pretty deep. Can be queried by Recipe, Ingredients, Nutrition, Equipment needed, Ingredients that must be excluded in said recipe.
6. MVP goals (x3-5): User will be able to enter available ingredients, receive list of recipes that incliude those ingredients. They will also be able to save, delete and favourite desired recipes.
7. Stretch goals (x2-5): User could search the returned recipes by type-of-cuisine via radio button. Or enter keywords, therefore excluding recipes that contain certain key words. e.g., I've entered tomatoes and asparagus, but omit nuts
8. Any potential roadblocks?: Where and what gets written to DB. API restrictions.

4. _After you have met with a staff member and your pitch has been approved, suggested next steps:_
   - Write out your routes and create a RESTful routing chart (good example [here](https://gk-hynes.github.io/restful-routes-chart/)).
   - Come up with a breakdown of what you plan to accomplish each day and how you are going to accomplish it.
   - Create a new git repo for your project.
